# United States GDP Data Visualization

This is a data visualization project created as part of the Data Visualization Certification from FreeCodeCamp. It uses D3.js to create an interactive bar chart that visualizes the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States from 1947 to 2015. The data is sourced from a public GDP dataset.

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the United States' GDP using a responsive bar chart. Each bar represents a quarter of a year and displays the corresponding GDP value. When the user hovers over a bar, a tooltip shows detailed information about the specific date and the GDP in billions. The chart includes axes, labels, and a dynamic transition effect on hover.

## Technologies Used
